The localized text strings in  “2b827952-8d1a-4c31-9283-8753d1fc51be” should have the time embeded (e.g: Starting in %(time) %(timeUnits) ... )
this was we avoid concatenating strings and complicated problems with string structure, grammar and more.
The localized text strings in "1981dc5a-a6b8-4fd3-be04-052522e08c86" could be more generic, today we want to say "I just reached number 1 in Country"
or "World" but if tomorow i want to say something like "I just reached number 1 in the region" i can't and i'll need to add another text entry
, better would be something like "I just reached number %(position) in %(leaderboard)" , this way i can add new rankings and use the same sentence for any
position.
